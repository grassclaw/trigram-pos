**Python Challenge Problem**
# Trigram/POS 

The following challenge problem is designed to assess incoming students that have not successfully completed UA CYBV 473 (Violent Python) and CYBV 474 (Advanced Analytics for Security Operations)

Rules:

1. Students must work independently.
2. They may use Python books and materials.
3. The student may use any Python Standard Libraries along with the 3rd party library Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and Matplotlib
4. The script will be written to work in standard Python 3.8 or above.
5. The script will be well documented.

**Challenge**:

The file **dialog.txt** has been provided and will serve as the input to the Python script.

The Python script shall perform the following operations:

Using Python along with the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) students will:

  1. Create an output file **Trigrams.csv** that contains the occurrences of each **unique word trigram** found in the text**.** The columns of the csv file will be **Trigram** and **Occurrences**. Note you will convert the text to all lowercase to ensure uniqueness of the Trigrams.
  2. Create an output file **Speech.jpg** that contains a graph of the frequency distribution of each Part of Speech found in the text. (You may choose the type of chart that best depicts the distribution).
  3. You will also submit your fully documented Python Script.
